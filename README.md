# Parkway Project - Transfer fees calculator

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d852f4e7-8dd1-4a54-b9f3-926b0e2124f1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/transferfeecalculator/deploys)

## How to access the solution

Clone this repo either through https or ssh.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies. They are pretty small.

Then run `parcel index.html` command to be able to access the solution on, normally, `https://localhost:1234` if not in use already.

In case you run into issues running the above command, check if parcel is installed,
otherwise you may need to install it by running:

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

or

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
if your prefer or use `npm`.

Thank you.
