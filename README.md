# Parkway Project - Transfer fees calculator

## How to access the solution

Clone this repo either through https or ssh.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies. They are pretty small.

Then run `parcel index.html` command to be able to access the solution on, normally, `https://localhost:1234` if not in use already.

In case you run into issues running the above command, check if parcel is installed,
otherwise you may need to install it by running:

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

or

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
if your prefer or use `npm`.

Thank you.
